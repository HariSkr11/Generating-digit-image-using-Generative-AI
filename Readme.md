# IMAGE DATA GENERATION USING GENERATIVE AI

## Variational auto encoders

Variational autoencoders are probabilistic generative models that require neural networks as only a part of their overall structure.
The neural network components are typically referred to as the encoder and decoder for the first and second component respectively.

## METHODOLOGY
Using the MNIST dataset available online, I will be building a VAR model for genenrating new images similar to the MNIST data
